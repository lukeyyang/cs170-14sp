\begin{abstract}
These notes were taken during CS 171 (Discrete Methods in Computer Science) taught
by Aaron \textsc{Cote} in
Spring 2014 at University of Southern California.
They were
live-\LaTeX\-ed during lectures in \texttt{TeXShop} and compiled using
\texttt{xelatex}. Each lecture gets its own section. The notes are not edited
afterward, so there may be typos; please email corrections to
\texttt{yifeiyan@usc.edu}.
